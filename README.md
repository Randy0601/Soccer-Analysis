### Run app.py file will open the index.html page within template, which reads the app.js file in static/js folder and both style.css and d3Style.css file in static/css folder
### histograms.html file reads from the histograms.js and style4.html files
### player_attr.html file reads from app2.js and style2.css files
### scatter.html file reads from app3.js, style3.css and d3style.css
### The procfile and requirement.txt are needed to setup Heroku
### All the images used in the webpages are stored in the static/images folder


# Soccer Analysis Visualization Project  ![soccer32](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39446363/47233177-833aee80-d397-11e8-83ce-7f565c170553.gif)


## Background
    The inspiration for this visualization tool is based on fantasy sports leagues 
    where the capacity to ascertain and analyze the abilities of indivual players 
    is critical in choosing players during the draft rounds. This visualization tool
    enables the objective comparison of players thus promoting strategic and 
    tactical choices of players during each draft round.
    


## Project Proposal

    Our team will compare player data from the international FIFA soccer video game
    We will visualize player attributes to determine:
  
      1) which attributes contribute to higher competitiveness
      2) Top Players
      3) Attribute distributions
